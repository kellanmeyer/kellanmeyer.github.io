			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>
				My name is Kellan Meyer, and I am 21 years old. I was adopted from South Korea when I was 5 months old, and
				I recently got into Korean skincare a couple of years ago when I started to try getting into Korean things to connect with my birth country.
				I've seen major differences in the way my skin looks and feels, and I wanted to share my knowledge to those who are interested in
				Korean skincare but don't know where to start!
			</p>

			<h2>My Skin Type</h2>
			<p>
				Your skin type is very important to know because different products are formulated for specific skin types in mind.
				For me, I have <strong>combination</strong> skin. This means that while most of my face is dry, my nose and forehead areas are oily.
				If you do not have this skin type, keep this in mind while reading about my recommendations and rejections.
				What works for me may not work for you, and what does not work for me may work for you!
