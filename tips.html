            <h2>Tip1: Always wear sunscreen!</h2>
            <p>
                Did you know that the sun's rays are harmful? While it seems weird, the sun emits harmful UV radiation that 
                can cause your skin to age faster, leading to wrinkles sooner in your life!
                Of course, you can't entirely avoid the sun, 
                so apply plenty of sunscreen to your face, neck, ears, chest, and any other skin that may be exposed.
            </p>

            <h2>Tip 2: Stay away from the tanning beds...</h2>
            <p>
                While you can't avoid the sun, you can definitely avoid the tanning bed!
                Tanning beds emit even more harmful UV radiation than the sun. 
                So while being tan is something many people want, your best bet is to just skip the tanning bed.
            </p>

            <h2>Tip 3: Pat and tap, don't rub!</h2>
            <p>
                Rubbing the products into your skin can cause the product to pill as well as skin irritation.
                You want to be as gentle with your skin as possible and make the best use of your product, so gently pat the product all over your face.
            </p>

            <h2>Tip 4: Cleanse for 60 seconds!</h2>
            <p>
                It is important to cleanse for a full 60 seconds to ensure that you properly remove any impurities.
                By not cleansing long enough, the ingredients in your cleanser aren't able to fully penetrate and clean your skin.
            </p>

            <h2>Tip 5: Apply from thinnest to thick!</h2>
            <p>
                The general order of skincare application is:
                <ol>
                    <li>Oil cleanser (PM only)</li>
                    <li>Cleanser</li>
                    <li>Toner</li>
                    <li>Serums, Essences, Ampoules</li>
                    <li>Moisturizer</li>
                    <li>Sunscreen (AM only)</li>
                </ol>
                This generally aligns with the "thinnest to thickest" method, but I was always confused on what order to apply my serums, essences, and ampoules.
                It's simple! Just apply them from thinnest consistency to the thickest consistency, then continue on with your moisturizer.
            </p>

            <h2>Tip 7: Double Cleanse your face at night!</h2>
            <p>
                Whether or not you put on makeup, washing away the sweat and grime that accumulated throughout the day is important.
                However, your regular cleanser won't be enough to fully cleanse these away.
                Oil cleansers and miscellar waters are specifically made to dissolve and remove oil-based impurities,
                such as makeup, sunscreen, sweat, blackheads, whiteheads, and sebum (natural oils).
                Because regular cleansers are <strong>water</strong>-based and oil is <em>hydrophobic</em> ("water-fearing"),
                using a regular cleanser will not effectively remove these oil-based impurities, so double cleansing with
                an oil cleanser or miscellar water is important!
                <br>
                <br>
                For <strong>oil cleansing</strong>, rub 2-3 pumps of oil cleanser on dry skin for 1-2 minutes, then <strong>emulsify</strong>
                by adding a small amount of water and continue to rub. Then rinse and continue with the rest of your routine.
                <br>
                <br>
                For <strong>miscellar water</strong> put some onto a cotton round or pad and gently rub onto the skin, making sure to get everywhere.
                Then continue with the rest of your routine.
            </p>

            <h2>Tip 8: Start simple, then add more!</h2>
            <p>
                My biggest mistake was suddenly using many different products at one time.
                This caused my skin to breakout and become irritated. This is called a <strong>damaged skin barrier</strong>.
                To avoid this, start with just a few steps in your skincare routine and slowly add additional products.
                This gives your skin time to adjust and not become overwhelmed by the amount of new ingredients.
            </p>

            <h2>Tip 9: I damaged my skin barrier, what do I do? Simplify your routine and focus on hydration and soothing!</h2>
            <p>
                If your skin is breaking out, red, irritated, dry, and/or stinging when you put skincare products on,
                you probably have a damaged skin barrier. Don't worry! Everything is fixable.
                To fix this, immediately cut out as many active ingredients as you can. These include any products with the following ingredients:
                <ul>
                    <li>Chemical Exfoliants (AHAs, BHAs, PHAs)</li>
                    <li>Vitamin C</li>
                    <li>Retinol and Retinoids</li>
                    <li>Niacinamide</li>
                </ul>
                While there are many ingredients that are considered active, these are the main ones you should focus on avoiding.
                Then, you should focus on using a simple routine with minimal steps, focusing on hydration and soothing your skin. 
                Personally, I've found the following AM/PM routines most effective:
                <ul>
                    <li>Morning Routine</li>
                    <ol>
                        <li>A gentle, non exfoliating cleanser</li>
                        <li>A hydrating toner with hyaluronic acid (hydrating)</li>
                        <li>An ampoule with centella asiatica (soothing)</li>
                        <li>A moisturizer with ceramides (hydrating and moisturizing)</li>
                        <li>Sunscreen</li>
                    </ol>

                    <li>Nighttime Routine</li>
                    <ol>
                        <li>An oil cleanser</li>
                        <li>A gentle, non exfoliating cleanser</li>
                        <li>A hydrating toner with hyaluronic acid (hydrating)</li>
                        <li>An ampoule with centella asiatica (soothing)</li>
                        <li>A moisturizer with ceramides (hydrating and moisturizing)</li>
                    </ol>
                </ul>
            </p>
