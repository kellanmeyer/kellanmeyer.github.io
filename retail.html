            <p>Korean Skincare is rarely sold in stores, and the popular Amazon is often full of fake products.
                To help you guys, I've compiled a list of three websites that offer shipping to the US.
                Plus, all of these websites offer free shipping over a certain spending threshold!

                <h2>Olive Young</h2>
                <p>
                    Olive Young is the biggest retailer for beauty products in South Korea, with over a thousand stores throughout the country.
                    While there aren't any stores in the US, they have a global website that ships to the US!
                    Olive Young is the best for finding value boxes, new member perks, and discounted prices on double packs of products.

                <h2>YesStyle</h2>
                <p>
                    YesStyle is an online retailer of Korean Skincare that ships globally.
                    They are the best for finding flash sales, regular discounts on a majority of products, and free express shipping
                    on big orders. It is important to note that their regular shipping is very slow (2-3 weeks).

                <h2>Style Korean</h2>
                <p>
                    Style Korean is another online retailer of Korean Skincare that ships globally.
                    Like YesStyle, they are also good for flash sales and regular discounts on many products.
                    However, I found that their shipping is much faster than YesStyle!
